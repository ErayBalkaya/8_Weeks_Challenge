Pizza Runner is the second case study of internet's famous 8 WEEK SQL CHALLENGE

The case study information provided has been sourced from [HERE](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/)

8 weeks challenge is a good way to practice sql especially for beginners.It helps you to improve your skills on EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

There is not much data about Pizza Runner challenge , but the secret here is to be able to find the correct ways to answer the questions.You can examine all 6 tables below.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ customer_orders

The customer_orders table captures customer pizza orders,order times and indegerents they want to add or remove from their order.

![customer_orders](https://github.com/ErayBalkaya/8_Weeks_Challenge/assets/159141102/72fb42b5-63ce-4c56-8047-972f38960ef9)


### 2Ô∏è‚É£ runner_orders

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The pickup_time is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. The distance and duration fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.

There are some known data issues with this table so be careful when using this in your queries - make sure to check the data types for each column in the schema SQL!

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ runners                                                                                                            

The runners table shows an unique ID for each runner and the dates that each runner registered

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ pizza_names  

Pizza Runner only has 2 pizzas available: the Meat Lovers or Vegetarian

![pizza_names](https://github.com/ErayBalkaya/8_Weeks_Challenge/assets/159141102/0e637bef-80ad-43ac-a579-8bcfb44e0290)

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ pizza_recipes 

Each pizza_id has a standard set of toppings which are used as part of the pizza recipe.

![pizza_recipes](https://github.com/ErayBalkaya/8_Weeks_Challenge/assets/159141102/eed55970-a22c-403f-aa3d-5a212e832665)

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ pizza_toppings

This table contains all of the topping_name values with their corresponding topping_id value

![pizza_toppings](https://github.com/ErayBalkaya/8_Weeks_Challenge/assets/159141102/06f557a9-669e-4ac9-887e-5ef16321a642)

‚≠êBefore you start writing your SQL queries however - you might want to investigate the data, you may want to do something with some of those null values and data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables!Click [HERE](https://github.com/ErayBalkaya/8_Weeks_Challenge/blob/main/Case_Study%232/Pizza_Runner.sql)
to see how.
## Case Study Questions

#### A. Pizza Metrics üçï üçï

1)How many pizzas were ordered?

2)How many unique customer orders were made?

3)How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?

4)How many of each type of pizza was delivered?

5)How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?

6)What was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order?

7)For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?

8)How many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?

9)What was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day?

10)What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?

#### B. Runner and Customer Experience :

1)How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

2)What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

3)Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

4)What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

5)What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

6)What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

7)What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

#### C. Ingredient Optimisation
1)What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

2)What was the most commonly added extra?

3)What was the most common exclusion?

4)Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:

  Meat Lovers :ü•©

  Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef ‚ùå ü•© ‚ùå

  Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon ü•ì :yum:

  Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

5)Generate an alphabetically ordered comma separated ingredient list for each pizza order from the customer_orders table and add a 2x in front of any relevant ingredients
For example: "Meat Lovers: 2xBacon, Beef, ... , Salami"

6)What is the total quantity of each ingredient used in all delivered pizzas sorted by most frequent first?

#### D. Pricing and Ratings :dollar: :dollar:

1)If a Meat Lovers pizza costs $12 and Vegetarian costs $10 and there were no charges for changes - how much money has Pizza Runner made so far if there are no delivery fees?

2)What if there was an additional $1 charge for any pizza extras?

3)The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner, how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

Using your newly generated table - can you join all of the information together to form a table which has the following information for successful deliveries?

    customer_id

    order_id

    runner_id

    rating

    order_time

    pickup_time

    Time between order and pickup

    Delivery duration

    Average speed

    Total number of pizzas

4)If a Meat Lovers pizza was $12 and Vegetarian $10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid $0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

#### 1)What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?
:triangular_flag_on_post: I first converted the comma-separated ID numbers in the 'pizza recipes' table into rows and assigned them as IDs.Then I merged the contents of the pizza with the pizza topping table in this way, and finally counted how many of each topping were used.

```sql

WITH toppings_fixed AS (
SELECT
  pizza_id,
  REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(toppings, '[,\s]+')::INTEGER AS topping_id
FROM pizza_recipes)

SELECT 
  tf.topping_id, pt.topping_name,
  COUNT(tf.topping_id) AS topping_count
FROM toppings_fixed tf
INNER JOIN pizza_toppings pt
  ON tf.topping_id = pt.topping_id
GROUP BY tf.topping_id, pt.topping_name
ORDER BY topping_count DESC;

#### 2)What if there was an additional üí≤1 charge for any pizza extras?

```sql

WITH TOTAL_INCOME AS
	(SELECT CO.PIZZA_ID,
			CO.ORDER_ID,
			CASE
				WHEN CO.PIZZA_ID = 1 THEN 12 * COUNT(CO.PIZZA_ID)
				WHEN CO.PIZZA_ID = 2 THEN 10 * COUNT(CO.PIZZA_ID)
				ELSE 0
			END AS PIZZA_FEE
		FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS CO
		LEFT JOIN RUNNER_ORDERS RO ON CO.ORDER_ID = RO.ORDER_ID
		WHERE RO.DURATION IS NOT NULL
		GROUP BY PIZZA_ID,
			CO.ORDER_ID),
	EXTRAS_FIXED AS
	(SELECT CO.ORDER_ID,
			CUSTOMER_ID,
			PIZZA_ID,
			REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(EXTRAS,'[,\s]+')::INTEGER AS EXTRAS_SEPERATE
		FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS CO 
	 JOIN RUNNER_ORDERS RO ON CO.ORDER_ID=RO.ORDER_ID
	WHERE DURATION IS NOT NULL),
	EXTRAS_FEES AS
	(SELECT PIZZA_ID,
			SUM(CASE
					WHEN EXTRAS_SEPERATE IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) EXTRAS_FEE
		FROM EXTRAS_FIXED
		GROUP BY 1),
	EXTRA_TOTAL AS
	(SELECT PIZZA_ID,
			EXTRAS_FEE * COUNT(PIZZA_ID)EXTRAS_SUM
		FROM EXTRAS_FEES
		GROUP BY 1,
			EXTRAS_FEE)
SELECT TI.PIZZA_ID,
	SUM(TI.PIZZA_FEE),
	ET.EXTRAS_SUM
FROM TOTAL_INCOME TI
JOIN EXTRA_TOTAL ET ON TI.PIZZA_ID = ET.PIZZA_ID
GROUP BY 1,3;

#### 3)The Pizza Runner team now wants to add an additional ratings system that allows customers to rate their runner,how would you design an additional table for this new dataset - generate a schema for this new table and insert your own data for ratings for each successful customer order between 1 to 5.

```sql

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS runner_ratings;
CREATE TABLE runner_ratings AS
SELECT ORDER_ID,
	RUNNER_ID,
	CASE
		WHEN DURATION IS NULL THEN DURATION
		WHEN DURATION <= 15 THEN 5
		WHEN DURATION > 15 AND DURATION <= 25 THEN 4
		WHEN DURATION > 25 AND DURATION <= 35 THEN 3
		WHEN DURATION > 35 AND DURATION <= 45 THEN 2
		WHEN DURATION > 45 THEN 1
	END AS RATINGS
FROM RUNNER_ORDERS;
SELECT * FROM RUNNER_RATINGS;

```

#### 4)If a Meat Lovers pizza was üí≤12 and Vegetarian üí≤10 fixed prices with no cost for extras and each runner is paid üí≤0.30 per kilometre traveled - how much money does Pizza Runner have left over after these deliveries?

```sql

WITH PIZZA_MONEY AS
	(SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN CO.PIZZA_ID = 1 THEN 12
						WHEN CO.PIZZA_ID = 2 THEN 10
							ELSE 0 END) AS PIZZA_FEE
		FROM CUSTOMER_ORDERS CO
		LEFT JOIN RUNNER_ORDERS RO ON CO.ORDER_ID = RO.ORDER_ID
		WHERE RO.DURATION IS NOT NULL ),
	RUNNER_MONEY AS
	(SELECT SUM(DISTANCE * 0.30)::bigint RUNNER_COST
		FROM RUNNER_ORDERS)
SELECT
	(SELECT PIZZA_FEE FROM PIZZA_MONEY) 
					-
	(SELECT RUNNER_COST FROM RUNNER_MONEY) AS TOTAL_COST;

```
